<h2 style="margin:0 0 10px;font-size:1.3em;color:#0f172a;">Why CloudScale Crash Recovery?</h2>
<p style="margin:0 0 10px;">Every WordPress site owner has experienced it: you click "Update" on a plugin, the page goes white, and suddenly your site is serving a 500 error to every visitor. Worse, you cannot log into wp-admin to fix it — because WordPress itself is broken.</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 10px;">CloudScale Crash Recovery watches your site from outside WordPress using your server's system cron. It probes your site every minute. The moment it detects a crash, it automatically deactivates and removes the most recently modified plugin — the most likely cause — and re-probes to confirm recovery. The whole process takes under two minutes.</p>
<p style="margin:0;"><strong>It is completely free.</strong> No premium version, no upgrade nag, no monthly fee. Install it, configure a system cron entry, and your site has automatic crash recovery running silently in the background.</p>
</div>
<p>The <strong>Watchdog Dashboard</strong> shows the real-time status of your automated crash recovery system. The watchdog is a PHP script invoked by a system cron job that makes an HTTP GET request to your site's frontend URL every minute. If the response code is not 200 OK, it triggers the recovery sequence.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Watchdog status</strong> — <em>Active</em>: the system cron is configured and the watchdog has probed the site within the last 2 minutes. <em>Inactive</em>: no recent probe recorded — check your crontab or see Setup &amp; Configuration.</li>
<li><strong>Last probe</strong> — exact timestamp of the most recent health check. If this timestamp is more than 3 minutes old and the watchdog shows Active, the cron job may be stalled or the PHP process is timing out. Investigate with <code>grep CRON /var/log/syslog | tail -20</code> (Linux) or <code>grep cron /var/log/system.log | tail -20</code> (macOS/cPanel).</li>
<li><strong>Last response code</strong> — the HTTP status code from the most recent probe request. 200 = healthy. 500 = PHP fatal error (most common cause of plugin-induced crashes). 503 = maintenance mode active. 301/302 = your homepage redirects — update the Probe URL to the redirect target to avoid false positives.</li>
<li><strong>Recovery count</strong> — cumulative number of automatic recoveries since the plugin was activated. A count above 0 means the watchdog has saved your site at least once. Each event is logged with full details in the Crash Log tab.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How the recovery sequence works:</strong> On detecting a non-200 response, the watchdog calls WP-CLI (<code>wp plugin deactivate</code> and <code>wp plugin delete</code>) on the plugin whose files in <code>wp-content/plugins/</code> have the most recent <code>mtime</code> within the configured recovery window (default: 10 minutes). It then re-probes the site. If the re-probe returns 200 OK, recovery is confirmed and the event is logged. If the re-probe still fails, the watchdog logs the failure and waits for the next cron cycle — it does not cascade-delete additional plugins.</p>`,

        'crash-log': `
<p>The <strong>Crash Log</strong> records every recovery event with enough detail to conduct a post-incident review and take preventive action.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Timestamp</strong> — exact date and time (server timezone) when the crash was first detected by the watchdog probe.</li>
<li><strong>HTTP status</strong> — the error code that triggered the recovery. <code>500 Internal Server Error</code> is the most common — indicates a PHP fatal error, typically caused by a plugin update that introduced a parse error or incompatible function call. <code>502 Bad Gateway</code> or <code>504 Gateway Timeout</code> indicate a PHP-FPM or web server process crash rather than a PHP code error.</li>
<li><strong>Plugin deactivated</strong> — the plugin folder name that was identified as the culprit and removed. Identification is based on the plugin directory with the most recent filesystem <code>mtime</code> within the recovery window. This is accurate when a plugin was updated or installed shortly before the crash, which covers the vast majority of plugin-induced outages.</li>
<li><strong>Recovery confirmed</strong> — <code>Yes</code> if the re-probe returned 200 OK after the plugin was removed. <code>No</code> means the site was still returning an error after the plugin was deactivated — the crash may have a different root cause (database corruption, server resource exhaustion, theme error).</li>
<li><strong>Response time</strong> — total elapsed time from crash detection to confirmed recovery, in seconds. Typical recovery time: 60–90 seconds (one cron cycle to detect + time to run WP-CLI + one re-probe).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Post-incident actions:</strong> After reviewing the log, reinstall the deactivated plugin only after confirming the crash root cause. Check the plugin's changelog for known PHP compatibility issues, or test the plugin on a staging environment before reactivating on production.</p>`,

        'setup': `
<p>The watchdog requires a <strong>system cron job</strong> — not WordPress WP-Cron — to run reliably every minute. WP-Cron is visitor-triggered: it only fires when a page is requested, cannot guarantee minute-level frequency, and does not run at all if your site is down (which is exactly when you need it).</p>
<p><strong>Setup steps:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Copy the exact cron command shown in this panel. It is pre-populated with the correct PHP binary path and WordPress root for your server. It will look similar to:<br><code>* * * * * /usr/bin/php /var/www/html/wp-content/plugins/cloudscale-crash-recovery/watchdog.php &gt;&gt; /var/log/cs-watchdog.log 2&gt;&amp;1</code></li>
<li>Open the crontab for the web server user: <code>sudo crontab -u apache -e</code> (Apache/RHEL) or <code>sudo crontab -u www-data -e</code> (Nginx/Debian). Using the web server user ensures the watchdog has the same filesystem permissions as WordPress itself.</li>
<li>Paste the command, save, and exit. Verify the cron was registered: <code>sudo crontab -u apache -l</code></li>
<li>Wait 2 minutes, then return to this panel. The <em>Last probe</em> timestamp should update and Watchdog Status should show <em>Active</em>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Test Connectivity</strong> to verify the watchdog can reach your site's probe URL and that the HTTP response is being recorded correctly.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Configuration options:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Probe URL</strong> — the URL the watchdog sends a GET request to. Defaults to your WordPress <code>home_url()</code>. Change this if: your homepage has a redirect (use the final destination URL), your homepage requires authentication, or you want to probe a specific health-check endpoint. The probe uses <code>wp_remote_get()</code> with a 10-second timeout and <code>sslverify = true</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Recovery window</strong> — how recently (in minutes) a plugin must have been modified on disk to be considered the crash culprit. Default: 10 minutes. If you deploy or update plugins frequently, reduce this to 5 minutes to avoid false positives. If you batch-install many plugins at once, increase it to 20–30 minutes.</li>
<li><strong>Notification email</strong> — the watchdog sends a plain-text email via <code>wp_mail()</code> to this address on every recovery event. Leave blank to disable email notifications. Check your server's mail delivery logs if emails are not arriving: <code>tail -50 /var/log/maillog</code></li>
</ul>`,
