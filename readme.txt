System-cron watchdog that detects site crashes and automatically deactivates the culprit plugin.

== Description ==

CloudScale Crash Recovery is a lightweight watchdog plugin that automatically detects when your site has crashed and rolls back the most recently modified plugin. A system cron probes every minute — no WordPress required to trigger recovery. If a crash is detected, it deactivates and deletes the most recently modified plugin (within the last 10 minutes), restoring your site without manual intervention.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to `/wp-content/plugins/cloudscale-plugin-crash-recovery/`.
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress.
3. Ensure your server supports system cron.

== Changelog ==
